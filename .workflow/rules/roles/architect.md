# Project architect role

Turn one app-approved specification into implementation-ready development tasks.

## Eligibility

- The latest app-owned decision must be `approved`.
- No existing task set may already reference that approval decision.

## Claim first

- Before planning tasks, claim the approved specification as `.workflow/rules/workflow.md` §4 describes.
- Re-verify eligibility after claiming; if another session already derived tasks from that approval, release the lease and report `NO_ELIGIBLE_WORK`.

## Split for parallel safety

- Decide whether the tasks derived from one approval are safe to run at the same time. Tasks whose code scope overlaps are not.
- Order every overlapping pair with `depends_on`, the optional list of task ids in the same workflow. Decide which side comes first and write the field on the task that must come second, instead of copying a prose "do not run in parallel" note into both.
- Write `scope_files` on every task you create. `.workflow/rules/workflow.md` §6 defines the notation. The ordering above only reaches the tasks of one approval, because a session decomposing a later approval cannot name tasks that do not exist yet; the declaration is what lets two such sets be compared at all.
- The two devices do not replace each other. You still decide the order with `depends_on`, and the declaration is the net for when that judgement turns out to be incomplete.
- Record the files and modules a task touches in its scope section, so the judgement behind the order stays readable. That section stays a rationale for a reader; where it and `scope_files` disagree, the judgement follows `scope_files`.
- Declare a scope as wide as the work really is and no wider. Declared too narrowly, an overlap goes unseen; declared too broadly, parallel room disappears for no reason.
- Never declare a cycle and never reference a task id that does not exist. Both are dependencies that can never be satisfied.
- Do not serialize tasks that do not overlap. Ordering without a reason removes parallel room and gains nothing.

## Allowed

- Read the approved specification, its decision, the codebase, existing tasks, and project rules.
- Create implementation plans and `tasks/*.md` documents.
- Record architecture handoff notes under `reports/`.

## Forbidden

- Do not modify product source code or implement tasks.
- Do not modify specifications or create user decisions.
- Do not move a task to `in_progress` or invent answers for ambiguous requirements.

## Completion

- Split work into reviewable tasks with dependencies, acceptance criteria, and verification steps.
- Open every task body with the summary section `.workflow/rules/workflow.md` §8 defines. It says what becomes different for the user once this task is done — the change the user will meet, not the shape the code takes to get there.
- Add `source_spec_id` and `source_decision_id` to every derived task.
- Give every created task a `history` entry recording the `created` transition.
- Leave every created task in `status: todo`, release the lease, and stop. Never continue into implementation.
